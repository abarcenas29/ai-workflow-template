# opencode Agent Instructions

## Project Context

This project includes AI-assisted development configuration distributed through the `ai-workflow-template` package. The key directories are:

- `.agents/instructions/` — Language, framework, and workflow instructions
- `.agents/skills/` — Reusable skill definitions for task-based workflows
- `.agents/agents/` — Specialized agent definitions for planning, research, and implementation
- `.agents/prompts/` — Reusable prompt templates

## Core Workflow

1. **Understand before acting** — Read relevant instructions from `.agents/instructions/` before working with specific technologies
2. **Plan before implementing** — Use `.agents/agents/plan.agent.md` or `.agents/agents/implementation-plan.agent.md` patterns for structured work
3. **Track progress** — Update `.copilot-tracking/changes/*.md` after each task (see `.agents/instructions/task-implementation.instructions.md`)
4. **Maintain context** — Keep memory bank files updated (see `.agents/instructions/memory-bank.instructions.md`)

## Available Agent Workflows

These agent workflows (from `.agents/agents/`) define specialized modes of operation. Invoke the relevant workflow at the start of a task by stating which mode you want to activate.

### Plan Mode — Strategic Planning & Architecture

Use this when starting a new feature, refactoring, or any non-trivial change. Follow this sequence:

1. **Understand the Goal** — Ask clarifying questions about requirements and goals
2. **Explore Context** — Examine relevant files, components, and systems that will be affected
3. **Identify Constraints** — Determine technical limitations, dependencies, and requirements
4. **Clarify Scope** — Establish how extensive the changes should be
5. **Review Existing Code** — How is similar functionality currently implemented?
6. **Identify Integration Points** — Where will new code connect to existing systems?
7. **Plan Step-by-Step** — Create a logical sequence for implementation
8. **Consider Testing** — How can the implementation be validated?
9. **Present Clear Plans** — Provide detailed strategy with reasoning, file paths, and order

Always prioritize understanding and planning over immediate implementation. Break down complex requirements into manageable components. Propose multiple approaches with trade-offs when viable alternatives exist.

### Implementation Plan Generation

Use this to create deterministic, structured plans saved to `/plan/`. Follow this template:

- Save files as `/plan/[purpose]-[component]-[version].md`
- Purpose prefixes: `upgrade|refactor|feature|data|infrastructure|process|architecture|design`
- **Required front matter**: `goal`, `version`, `date_created`, `status` (Completed/In progress/Planned/Deprecated/On Hold), `tags`
- **Required sections** (in order):
  1. Introduction (with status badge)
  2. Requirements & Constraints (with REQ-, SEC-, CON- identifiers)
  3. Implementation Steps (phases with task tables: Task ID, Description, Completed, Date)
  4. Alternatives (ALT- identifiers with rationale)
  5. Dependencies (DEP- identifiers)
  6. Files (FILE- identifiers)
  7. Testing (TEST- identifiers)
  8. Risks & Assumptions (RISK-, ASSUMPTION- identifiers)
  9. Related Specifications

Plans must be deterministic, self-contained, and immediately actionable. Use unambiguous language, specific file paths, and explicit completion criteria per task. DO NOT make code edits — only generate the plan.

### Research Spike — Systematic Technical Investigation

Use this when investigating technical unknowns, evaluating libraries, or validating approaches. Follow this process:

1. **Parse Spike** — Read and understand the spike document; identify all research questions and success criteria
2. **Investigate Exhaustively** — Research official docs, search for code examples, examine real implementations, explore edge cases
3. **Recursive Research** — For every new term/concept discovered, immediately investigate it; continue until no new relevant information emerges
4. **Cross-Reference** — Validate findings across multiple sources; document both successes AND dead ends
5. **Experimental Validation** — Ask permission before creating files or running commands; design minimal proof-of-concept tests
6. **Continuous Documentation** — Update the spike document continuously as discoveries are made (not just at the end)
7. **Evidence Standards** — Cite specific sources with URLs and versions; include timestamps; note limitations

Always ask user permission before: creating files, running commands, modifying the system, or experimental operations.
